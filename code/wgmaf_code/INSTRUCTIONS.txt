The code in ./scripts generate WGMAF values. Shell scripts were run using the Sun Grid Engine (SGE) computing system and 
and contain options that were passed to the 'qsub' command at the top of the script. For a detailed description of these options, please see
the SGE manual (https://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/manuals.html). Note that file paths are relative to the ./scripts directory.

Scripts must be run in the following order:

i01-get-gnomad.sh (runs i01-get-gnomad.R)
i02-get-liftover-chain.sh
i03-strelka.sh
i04-plasma-sbs-detection.sh (runs i04-plasma-sbs-detection.R)
i05-compute-wgmaf.R
